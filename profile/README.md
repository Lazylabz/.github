# 🚀 Welcome to Lazy Labz

**Where laziness meets innovation** ⚡

We're **[Moises](https://github.com/moisesrj97)** and **[Noel](https://github.com/noel-lopez)** - two developers who got tired of repetitive, tedious tasks and decided to do something about it. Our mission? Build tools that make developers' lives easier, one _lazy_ solution at a time.

## 🛠️ What We Build

**Projects by developers, for developers.** We focus on tools that solve real problems we've experienced firsthand. No theoretical solutions here - just practical tools born from genuine frustration and the desire to work smarter, not harder.

Here's the thing: we call ourselves lazy, but we end up spending our free time building tools to automate the stuff that annoys us. Ironic? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.

**Our approach is simple:**
- Spot a pain point in our daily dev workflow
- Get annoyed enough to do something about it
- Build a solution that we actually want to use
- Share it with fellow developers who face the same struggles

## 🎯 Our Mission

Making development workflows less painful, one tool at a time. We believe the best developer tools come from developers who actually use them daily.
